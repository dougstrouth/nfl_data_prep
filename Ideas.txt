add in a thing to look up roster from that particular game 
Is there a db that has unique game ids already?


I need the current rosters of all the teams so that I can see who contributes most to success

Create a view call that takes a team and certain details to give filtered tables about that team
What other common stats would I wanna be able to pull fast?
